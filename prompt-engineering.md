## 🔍 Why does prompt matter?

AI models don’t really “understand” your question like a human. They predict what text should come next based on your input.  
So, if your prompt is vague or confusing, the answer might be too.

Good prompt engineering helps get:
- More accurate answers  
- Creative ideas  
- Useful code snippets  
- Better summaries

## ✍️ How to write a good prompt?

- Be **specific**: say exactly what you want  
- Add **context**: background info helps the AI  
- Use examples to show what you expect  
- Ask step-by-step or break complex tasks into parts

**Poor prompt:**  
“Tell me about cats.”

**Better prompt:**  
“Write a short, friendly paragraph explaining why cats make good pets, for a blog post aimed at new pet owners.”
